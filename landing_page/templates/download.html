    <h1>Get DevAssistant</h1>
</div>

<h2>Install in Fedora</h2>
<p>We recommend running Fedora (the Linux OS; you can get it
    <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/en/get-fedora">here</a>). With Fedora running, you can install
    DevAssistant simply by executing
</p>
<div class="well"># yum install devassistant</div>
<p>in the command line or installing devassistant through Yum-Extender or Gnome-PackageKit by searching for devassistant.

<h2>Install with pip</h2>
<p>DevAssistant is available for download via pip, the Python package
installer. If your operating system has a package manager, you can install pip
with it (precise method depends on your OS). The package is usually named pip
or python-pip. If your system doesn't have a package manager, you can <a
href="http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html">download pip</a>.
<div class="well">
    $ pip install devassistant
</div>
<p>Bear in mind, though, that you don't get automatic updates with pip as opposed to the option above.</p>
